"""
Hydra Bio Cryo Utilities
.
A PySide6/QML desktop UI for the Thermo Scientific Hydra Bio microscope
(AutoScript >= 4.13). Run this file to launch; pass ``--simulation`` to
start without a microscope connection. Application logic lives in the
``hydra_bio_cu`` package -- this module only wires up the Qt application,
the QML engine, and the controllers.
