"""Home Stage activity.

Procedure:
    1. Home all stage axes via ``microscope.specimen.stage.home()``.
       This is a blocking, uninterruptible AutoScript call; the stage
       is in motion until it returns.

After homing, the stage is left at its homed position. Returning the
stage to where the session began is a *workflow-level* concern driven
by the "Move Stage To Original Position" setting and handled by the
workflow runner's stage-position recorder (see
:class:`hydra_bio_cu.microscope.recorders.stage_position.StageRecorder`)
— not by this activity.

This activity previously performed a local "return to the pre-home
position" move when the setting was on. That conflated homing with
session-level restore and returned the stage to an arbitrary
intermediate position (wherever the preceding activity left it, since
Home Stage runs last), not the position the user started from. It was
removed when the workflow-level restore was implemented; the setting
now drives only the workflow runner's recorder.

Stop semantics
--------------
The home() call cannot be interrupted mid-flight — once started, the
activity waits for the stage to finish homing. The activity checks the
stop event:

    * **before** calling ``home()`` (so a stop click before homing
      starts is honored immediately), and
    * **after** ``home()`` returns (so a stop click during the home
      is reported as a STOP result once home completes).

Reporting STOP on the post-home check matters for the new restore
policy: a STOP result propagates to the workflow runner as a
non-successful exit, which suppresses the workflow-level stage
restore — exactly the desired behavior, since the user interrupted
the run.
