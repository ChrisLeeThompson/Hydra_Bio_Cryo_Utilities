"""Workflow settings snapshot.

A frozen, immutable capture of the user-preferences fields that drive
workflow behavior. Constructed in :meth:`WorkflowRunner._on_commit_to_run`
(which fires once the workflow commits to running, after validation
passes — mirroring the timing of :class:`PFIBConditionsRecorder`
construction) and consumed by per-activity ``_build_*`` methods during
the run.

Why a snapshot
--------------
Activities are constructed just-in-time inside
:meth:`WorkflowRunner._next_pending_activity` rather than at workflow
Start. Without a snapshot, a setting read inside a ``_build_*`` method
would be re-read live each iteration — meaning a user editing the
Settings page mid-run would silently change the behavior of an
activity that hadn't been built yet (e.g. a new GIS port name taking
effect on the next GIS Deposition, or toggling
``moveStageToOriginalPosition`` flipping the Home Stage's restore
behavior moments before it runs).

Capturing the values once at commit time means the running workflow
uses the values that were in effect when the run started, regardless
of what the user does in the Settings page during the run.

The Settings page UI also disables the workflow-affecting controls
during a run as a UX cue (see :attr:`AppController.anyWorkflowRunning`).
The snapshot is the load-bearing safety mechanism; the UI lock is
clarity layered on top.

Shared between RT and CP
------------------------
Both :class:`RTWorkflow` and :class:`CPWorkflow` capture the same
dataclass — RT just doesn't read the two ``restore_pfib_*`` fields
(its only PFIB-touching activity is GIS Purge, and PFIB-state restore
is a CP-only feature). A single shape avoids divergence if a future
RT activity grows the same dependency.
