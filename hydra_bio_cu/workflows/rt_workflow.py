"""RT Prep workflow runner.

Holds the parameters and per-activity enabled-state for the RT Prep page,
and constructs activities on demand as the workflow runner asks for the
next pending activity.

Currently exposes two activities: GIS Purge and Home Stage.

Iterative-fetch architecture
----------------------------
RT walks a static two-element ordered list (GIS Purge, then Home Stage)
in :meth:`_next_pending_activity`. Mid-run switch toggles fold in for
free — a disabled activity isn't pending and isn't returned. The page
has no mechanism for adding activities mid-run (unlike the Cryo page),
so the static order is fixed.

Validation
----------
Two passes, both lighter than :class:`CPWorkflow`'s:

* **Pre-start check at start** — :meth:`_validate_pre_start` gathers
  the checks declared by each enabled activity class and runs them
  through the orchestrator. A REFUSE outcome (none possible today
  on RT — Home Stage's only check is the stage-position advisory)
  refuses the start with :attr:`preStartCheckRefused`. An
  ASK_CONFIRM outcome (e.g. stage in an unusual position when Home
  Stage is enabled) pauses the start pending user confirmation via
  the runner's two-step Start state machine. GIS Purge contributes
  no checks per the pre-start check design (RT-page GIS purge
  doesn't move the stage and has no Z-link dependency).

  RT has no separate parameter-validation pass — parameter values
  are clamped at write time by the Property setters and the
  activity list is static, so there's nothing to validate beyond
  the pre-start checks.

* **Mid-run (planned)** — TODO step 9: per-activity pre-start
  check re-evaluation at fetch time, consulting
  :attr:`WorkflowRunner._confirmed_check_types` to avoid reprompting
  for confirmations the user already accepted at Start.

Persistence
-----------
Parameter values (durations, recovery times) persist across sessions via
:class:`QSettings`, mirroring the pattern used by
:class:`SettingsController`. Keys are namespaced under ``v3/rtWorkflow/``
so they don't collide with app-level settings.

Activity-enabled flags (the container switches) are intentionally *not*
persisted — the user opts in fresh each session, matching v2.1's
behavior. Auto-running hardware activities at startup is the kind of
surprise we want to avoid.

Future Templates feature
------------------------
Workflow templates will serialize the same parameter values via a
different code path (a JSON file the user names) — the parameters are
the source of truth, regardless of whether they're loaded from
QSettings, a template file, or default values.
