"""Cryo Prep workflow runner.

Runs a user-composed list of Cryo activities (Sputter Coat, GIS
Deposition) plus an optional Home Stage at the end. The activity list
and per-activity parameters are owned by :class:`CryoActivitiesController`;
this runner reads them as the workflow runner asks for the next
pending activity, so additions, deletions, and switch toggles made
mid-run take effect at the next fetch. Switches are session-only and
default to off; :attr:`canStart` is true iff at least one activity (or
Home Stage) is enabled and the workflow isn't already running.

Validation runs in three passes: parameter validation of every enabled
activity at Start (all-or-nothing, every failure reported via
:attr:`validationFailed`); the pre-start checks declared by each
enabled activity class, routed through the runner's two-step Start
(REFUSE / ASK_CONFIRM); and a per-fetch repeat of both for the activity
about to run. A mid-run failure aborts the workflow rather than
skipping the activity — successive Sputter Coat / GIS Deposition
activities lay down dependent material layers, and a missing
intermediate layer is worse than running fewer activities.

PFIB conditions are captured once in :meth:`_before_run` and restored
in :meth:`_after_run` when either PFIB-restore setting is on. The two
settings map to the recorder's two restore groups — beam-electrical
(high voltage, beam current, on/off) and ion species (plasma gas) —
so the user can revert one without the other. Every restore (PFIB and
stage position) fires only after a fully successful run; a stopped,
failed, or aborted run leaves the microscope exactly as it is.
