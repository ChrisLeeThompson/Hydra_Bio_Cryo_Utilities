"""Template-file (JSON) <-> activity-record translation.

This module is the cross-machine portability boundary for Cryo Prep
templates. Records hold a ``position_id`` that is local to one
machine's QSettings; templates store ``position_name`` because names
are unique (enforced by the Add/Edit dialogs in
:mod:`stage_positions`) and meaningful across machines.

``instance_id`` is stripped on save (templates are blueprints, not
instances; ids are minted fresh on load). All functions here are pure
— file I/O lives in :class:`CryoActivitiesController` — and the
positions dependency is the :class:`PositionsLookup` Protocol rather
than the controller itself, so the module is testable without Qt.

Validation policy
-----------------
Two-tier:

* **Structural failures** (not a JSON object, schema version
  mismatch, ``cryo_prep_page_activities`` missing or not a list)
  produce a :class:`LoadResult` with ``records=None`` and an
  ``error_message``; the controller leaves the existing list
  untouched.
* **Data failures** are repaired and recorded in the ``issues`` list
  the controller surfaces in the load summary: missing field →
  silent default (normal forward-compat); wrong-type field → default
  + issue; out-of-range numeric → clamp + issue; unmatched
  ``position_name`` → empty ``position_id`` + issue (an empty or
  missing name is a normal "no selection", not an issue); unknown
  ``activity_type`` → entry dropped + issue.

A missing ``schema_version`` is treated as v1 (lenient); a
present-but-mismatched one is rejected (strict).

    resolve to any saved position becomes an empty ``position_id``
    *and* produces an issue — the user needs to know that an
    activity arrived without its target position.

    When ``position_name_remap`` carries the name (the positions were
    bundled and imported this load), it wins over the library lookup so
    the activity binds to the template's own copy — even if a
    different, same-named position already exists locally.
