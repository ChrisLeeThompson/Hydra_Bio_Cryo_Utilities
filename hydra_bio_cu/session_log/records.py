"""JSON-serializable entries for the session log file.

Three entry kinds, one line of JSONL each:

* :class:`SessionBeginEntry` — written at workflow start. Carries the
  session identity, workflow type, start timestamp, and the editable
  ``notes`` field. Notes live here (not on the end entry) so that
  *interrupted* sessions — which by definition never get an end
  entry written — can still be annotated.

* :class:`SessionEndEntry` — written at workflow finish. Carries the
  outcome (``all_complete``) and total wall-clock duration. May not
  exist for an interrupted session; reconciliation explicitly handles
  the missing-end case.

* :class:`ActivityLogEntry` — written once per activity finish. Carries
  the activity's result, duration, last status message, and the
  parameter dict returned by
  :meth:`hydra_bio_cu.activities.base.ActivityService.parameter_summary`.
  Also carries a latent ``notes`` field that the system writes empty
  and the UI does not yet surface — per the design's "latent capacity,
  not built capability" principle, this leaves room for per-activity
  annotation later without a file-format migration.

The discriminator field is ``kind``; :func:`entry_from_dict` dispatches
on it. This mirrors :func:`hydra_bio_cu.cryo.activity_records.record_from_dict`
(which dispatches on ``activity_type``) — same pattern, different
domain.

Naming
------
The cryo subpackage uses *Record* for objects that describe activities
to RUN. This subpackage uses *Entry* for objects that record activities
that HAVE RUN. The vocabulary distinction is deliberate and prevents
namespace collision with
:data:`hydra_bio_cu.cryo.activity_records.ActivityRecord`.

Schema versioning
-----------------
Every entry carries a ``"v"`` field stamping the schema version. The
loader / dispatcher logs a warning on unfamiliar versions but still
attempts to parse, on the principle that the log is observational and
"some data" beats "no data." Mandatory fields missing → the
``from_dict`` raises and the caller drops that entry with a warning.

Forward-compatibility limit: unknown extra fields on a known entry
kind do not break loading, but they are NOT preserved through a
rewrite (the dataclass's ``to_dict`` only emits known fields). For
v=1 → v=1 round-trips this is invisible; if a future v=2 ever ships,
older versions reading-then-rewriting would silently drop the v=2
fields. Acceptable trade-off at v=1; revisit if v=2 ever arrives.
