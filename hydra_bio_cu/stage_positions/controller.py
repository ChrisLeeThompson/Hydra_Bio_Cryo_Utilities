"""Stage Positions controller — QML-facing surface for saved positions.

Owns the :class:`StagePositionsModel`, the JSON persistence path, and
the worker-thread machinery for the Move To operation. Exposes
high-level operations to QML (``add_from_current``,
``update_from_current``, etc.) that combine reading the live stage
position with model mutation. QML never reads the stage directly —
all coordinate-producing operations go through this controller.

Move To threading
-----------------
``move_to(position_id)`` runs the actual ``absolute_move()`` on a
short-lived :class:`QThread` worker, mirroring the connect-thread
pattern in :mod:`app_controller`. The blocking call lives entirely
on the worker thread; the GUI thread observes the operation through
``isMoving``, ``moveStarted``, ``moveFinished``, and ``statusUpdated``
signals.

Error handling
--------------
A failed ``absolute_move()`` is logged with a full traceback and
surfaced to QML via ``moveFinished(success=False)``. The error
message itself is intentionally not exposed as a property — QML's
response is to open a generic "Stage Move Error" dialog directing
the user to the logs. AutoScript exception messages can be cryptic
to non-developers, and centralizing diagnostics in the log file
matches our broader pattern.

Pre-start checks for Move To
----------------------------
A Move To gesture is gated by the pre-start check system, mirroring
:class:`hydra_bio_cu.stage_scan.controller.StageScanController`'s
gating of stage rotation. Before a move worker is spawned,
:meth:`move_to` gathers the move's pre-start checks (today: a
single :class:`StagePositionWithinSafeRangeCheck`), runs them
through the orchestrator, and routes the outcome:

* REFUSE → emit :attr:`preStartCheckRefused` with the
  check-result items, status breadcrumb ``"Pre-start check
  failed"``, no worker spawned.
* ASK_CONFIRM → emit :attr:`preStartCheckNeedsConfirmation`,
  stash a :class:`_PendingMove`, wait for QML to call
  :meth:`respondToConfirmation`. Accept →
  :meth:`_spawn_move_worker`; reject → "Stage move cancelled"
  breadcrumb.
* PASS → :meth:`_spawn_move_worker` immediately.

The intent dialog ("Move the stage to X?") in QML is left in
place. On the override path the user sees two dialogs in
sequence: the intent confirm, then the safety acknowledgement.
The two protect against different failure modes (accidental
click vs. unusual current position) and are gated separately
on purpose.

class _PendingMove:
    """Resume state for a Move To paused at the ASK_CONFIRM gate.

    Populated by :meth:`StagePositionsController.move_to` when the
    pre-start check pass produces ASK_CONFIRM; consumed (and
    cleared) on either branch of
    :meth:`StagePositionsController.respondToConfirmation`.

    Parallels :class:`hydra_bio_cu.pre_start_checks.PendingStart`
    in role (the carrier of the "pending confirmation" state),
    but adds the resolved move target so the accept path can
    spawn the worker without re-walking the positions model.
    The shared :class:`PendingStart` carries only the check
    types, which is enough for a parameterless gesture
    (rotation) but not for a parameterized one (move).

    Pre-resolving the target also keeps the spawn path symmetric
    with the all-pass spawn path — both call
    :meth:`_spawn_move_worker` with an already-resolved
    StagePosition rather than the model index. The
    ConfirmDialog is modal so the model can't shift while the
    user is responding, but pre-resolving is cheaper than
    re-resolving and is unambiguous about what gets moved to.

    Frozen so the resume path can't accidentally mutate the
    captured state mid-flight.

    Attributes:
        target: The resolved AutoScript ``StagePosition`` (real
            or simulated) for the absolute_move call. Typed as
            ``object`` because the real and simulated facades
            return distinct concrete types and we don't import
            either here.
        position_name: User-visible name, used for the
            ``"Moving stage to: X..."`` and ``"Stage moved to:
            X"`` status messages.
        position_id: Opaque id of the saved row, used only in
            log messages.
        confirmed_check_types: Set of check types the user is
            being asked to confirm. On accept, carried into
            :attr:`StagePositionsController._confirmed_check_types`
            for cross-surface parity with other consumers (the
            move has no mid-run re-check today, so this field
            is populated but not consulted).
