"""Application-wide default values and bounds.

Single source of truth for behavioral constants: the values the app
falls back to when no user-saved override exists, and the bounds used
both for clamping setters and for QML SpinBox ``from`` / ``to``
properties (exposed via controller Q_INVOKABLE getters).

Sections are organized by feature area. Settings and workflow modules
import from this module rather than holding their own ``defaults.py``
files — there are few enough values that one file is easier to edit
and to grep.

What's *not* here: pure UI / visual constants (margins, colors,
spacing, animation durations) live in ``qml_resources/Config/AppConfig.qml``.

# Step size matches v2.1 (2.5 µm/step). Tick interval (50 ms) keeps
# the slider responsive without spamming the AutoScript input queue.

# worker produces ~1.25 mm/s of effective Z velocity at the extremes.
#
# Reduce STAGE_Z_STEP_SIZE_M for finer manual control; increase

# and Move To gestures). The threshold is intentionally
# conservative — it catches operationally unusual positions,
# not physically dangerous ones — the user can still confirm
# and proceed. Bump this as real hardware experience accrues.
#
# Tilt was previously included as a third axis-wise component
# and was dropped: legitimate operating positions (e.g., the
# GIS deposition default at 60°) routinely exceed any
# conservative tilt threshold, and the radial XY check already
# catches the operationally unusual positions where tilt would
# correlate with concern. The snapshot still carries
# ``stage_t_rad`` for future checks that may need it.

#   * DEV_FORCE_SIMULATION is read by the entry point
#     (hydra_bio_cryo_utilities.py); it has no effect once a client
#     (real or simulated) exists.
#   * DEV_FORCE_UNLINKED / DEV_FORCE_STAGE_OUT_OF_RANGE are read ONLY by
#     SimulatedStageOps (microscope/stage_ops.py) and have NO effect on
#     the real StageOps facade.
#
# DEV_FORCE_SIMULATION:
#   Skip the microscope connection attempt entirely and start in
#   simulation mode (equivalent to passing --simulation on the command
#   line). The entry point ORs this with the --simulation flag and logs a
#   warning when it is set. Set back to False before distributing.

# The two stage-state seeds below let the pre-start check dialogs be

# DEV_FORCE_STAGE_OUT_OF_RANGE:
#   Start the simulated stage at DEV_FORCED_OUT_OF_RANGE_RADIAL_M from
#   chamber center, so StagePositionWithinSafeRangeCheck returns
#   ASK_CONFIRM for any gated gesture (GIS Deposition, Sputter Coat,
