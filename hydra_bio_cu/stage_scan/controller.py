"""Stage / Scan page controller.

Manual-assist controller backing the Stage / Scan page. The page hosts
three direct user-gesture operations:

* **Stage rotation** (and its tilt-before / tilt-after variants).
  Multi-phase, threaded, claims the cross-page lock. Implemented at
  B5. Gated by a pre-start check pass — see "Pre-start checks for
  rotation" below.
* **Scan rotate SEM and FIB** to a chosen canonical angle (0 or π
  rad). Synchronous, no thread, doesn't claim the lock — two
  AutoScript property writes done before the next QML frame paints.
  Two explicit Slots, ``set_scan_rotation_to_0`` and
  ``set_scan_rotation_to_180``, let the user normalize the beams to
  a known canonical pair regardless of starting state. The rotation
  worker's optional "scan rotate after" chained phase uses a
  separate additive-delta helper (:meth:`_rotate_scan_by_180`)
  rather than these absolute setters — see "Chained scan rotate
  after rotation" below for the contract distinction.
* **Stage Z slider.** Continuous streaming relative-moves while the
  user holds the slider. Implemented at B6.

Layering
--------
The controller consumes hardware ops (``microscope.electron_beam``,
``microscope.ion_beam``, ``microscope.stage``) and exposes operations
to QML as ``@Slot`` methods. It does NOT reach into the underlying
``SdbMicroscopeClient`` directly — all SDK contact goes through the
ops facades in :mod:`hydra_bio_cu.microscope`.

Stage rotation: planner / worker / controller split
---------------------------------------------------
The rotation operation is decomposed into three layers:

* :func:`_plan_rotation_phases` — pure function that takes the four
  user settings and returns an ordered ``list[_RotatePhase]``.
  Testable in isolation; no Qt, no microscope, no I/O.
* :class:`_StageRotateWorker` — Qt worker that lives on a dedicated
  :class:`QThread` for the duration of one rotation. Iterates the
  plan, executing each phase via the microscope ops, with a
  ``threading.Event`` checked between phases so a stop request takes
  effect at the next phase boundary. Emits ``phaseStarted`` before
  each phase begins so the controller can drive per-phase status
  text on the GUI thread.
* :class:`StageScanController` — owns the worker lifecycle, surfaces
  the operation to QML via :meth:`start_rotation` / :meth:`stop`, and
  exposes ``isRotating`` plus paired ``rotationStarted`` /
  ``rotationFinished`` signals for consumer flexibility.

Z slider: long-lived worker
---------------------------
Unlike the rotation worker (one thread per gesture), the Z worker is
long-lived — constructed and started in :meth:`StageScanController.__init__`,
torn down in :meth:`StageScanController.shutdown`. It sleeps on a
50 ms tick and only issues a hardware move when the slider value is
non-zero. Errors fail-lock the worker until the slider returns to
zero (the user releases it), then resume; this is simpler and safer
than a retry/backoff scheme — the user is always in the loop.

Chained "scan rotate after rotation" contract
---------------------------------------------
The rotation worker's optional :data:`PHASE_SCAN_ROTATE_AFTER` phase
runs when ``scanRotateAfterRotation`` is checked. It calls
:meth:`_rotate_scan_by_180`, which adds π radians to whatever the
current scan rotation is on each beam — *not* an absolute set to 0
or π — and wraps the sum into [0, 2π) before writing, because
AutoScript's ``scanning.rotation`` rejects values outside that
range.

The additive-delta contract is the right one because the chained
phase's job is to compensate for the 180° physical rotation that
just happened, not to normalize to a canonical state. After a 180°
stage rotation, the imaging frame is upside-down; adding 180° to
the scan rotation flips it back, regardless of what the scan
rotation value was beforehand. If the user had a non-canonical
starting value (e.g. 30°), the chain produces 30° + 180° = 210° —
still mathematically correct as a compensating flip, even if the
read-back value is unusual. The wrap changes nothing semantically
(rotation is periodic in 2π); it only keeps the written value in
AutoScript's accepted domain — from the common π starting point the
chain lands back at 0 rather than attempting 2π, which the hardware
would reject.

The two explicit setter Slots (:meth:`set_scan_rotation_to_0` and
:meth:`set_scan_rotation_to_180`) are the user's escape hatch for
normalizing back to canonical values whenever the read-back drifts.

Pre-start checks for rotation
-----------------------------
Stage rotation goes through the two-step Start pattern shared with
the workflow runners. Before a worker is spawned,
:meth:`start_rotation` gathers the rotation's pre-start checks
(today: a single :class:`StagePositionWithinSafeRangeCheck`), runs
them through the orchestrator, and routes the outcome:

* REFUSE → emit :attr:`preStartCheckRefused` with the
  check-result items, status breadcrumb ``"Pre-start check
  failed"``, no worker spawned.
* ASK_CONFIRM → emit :attr:`preStartCheckNeedsConfirmation`,
  stash a :class:`PendingStart`, wait for QML to call
  :meth:`respondToConfirmation`. Accept →
  :meth:`_spawn_rotation_worker`; reject → "Stage rotation
  cancelled" breadcrumb.
* PASS → :meth:`_spawn_rotation_worker` immediately.

Z slider gestures are intentionally NOT gated by pre-start checks
today — streaming relative-move semantics don't map cleanly to a
gate-and-resume flow. Deferred for a future iteration.

State recording
---------------
None. This controller backs a manual-assist page; operations are
direct user gestures with no side-effect bracketing. See the Q16
discussion in the design notes for the rationale.

class _StageRotateWorker(QObject):
    """Worker that executes a rotation plan on a dedicated thread.

    Lifecycle
    ---------
    Lives on a :class:`QThread` for the duration of one rotation,
    then is destroyed via ``deleteLater`` once :attr:`finished` has
    been emitted. Single-shot — do not reuse.

    Stop semantics
    --------------
    Stage moves are synchronous and uninterruptible from another
    thread (cross-thread ``stop()`` calls would queue behind the
    in-flight move on AutoScript's input queue). The worker therefore
    checks ``stop_event`` *between* phases — a stop request takes
    effect at the next phase boundary, not mid-phase.

    Phase-started signal
    --------------------
    ``phaseStarted(kind: str, tilt_rad: float)`` is emitted just
    before each phase begins executing (after the per-phase cancel
    check passes). The payload is intentionally structured rather
    than pre-formatted so that user-facing strings stay co-located
    with the rest of the controller's ``statusUpdated`` emits — the
    worker has no UI vocabulary. The connection in
    :meth:`StageScanController._spawn_rotation_worker` is queued
    (auto), so the controller's slot runs on the GUI thread.

    Finished signal
    ---------------
    ``finished(success: bool, reason: str)``:

    * ``success=True, reason=""`` — all phases ran to completion.
    * ``success=False, reason="cancelled"`` — stop_event was set
      before some phase started.
    * ``success=False, reason=<message>`` — a phase raised an
      exception. The message names the failing phase. The
      controller's :meth:`StageScanController._on_rotate_finished`
      does *not* parse this payload; it uses its remembered friendly
      phase text instead ("short status bar, console for the why").

    Lifecycle
    ---------

    :meth:`StageScanController.shutdown`. Unlike the rotation worker,
    one Z worker handles every Z-slider gesture across the app's
    session — the per-gesture cost is amortized away.

    Tick semantics
    --------------
    On each tick (every :data:`defaults.STAGE_Z_TICK_INTERVAL_S`
    seconds, or as soon as ``stop_event`` is set), the worker:

    1. Reads the slider value from :class:`_SliderState`.
    2. If fail-locked: clears the lock if the slider is at 0, else
       skips this tick. (The user has to release the slider before
       another move is attempted — see :meth:`run` for rationale.)
    3. If the slider is at 0: skips this tick (idle).
    4. Otherwise: issues a relative ``z`` move equal to
       ``slider_value × STAGE_Z_STEP_SIZE_M``, with ``link_z_y=True``
       so the Y axis compensates per xT's "Link Z to Y" behavior.

    Errors
    ------
    Any exception from ``relative_move`` puts the worker into a
    fail-locked state: an :attr:`errorOccurred` signal is emitted
    once, and no further moves are attempted until the user releases
    the slider (so it returns to 0). This is intentionally simpler
    than retry-with-backoff — the user is always in the loop, and a
    persistent error (e.g. a stage interlock fault) shouldn't keep
    spamming the hardware while the user is still pressing the
