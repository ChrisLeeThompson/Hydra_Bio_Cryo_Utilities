"""Pure state machine for the Z-slider safety gate.

The Z height slider on the Stage / Scan page is gated when the stage is
parked outside the safe range, so the user makes a deliberate choice
before nudging Z from an operationally unusual position. This module is
the decision core of that gate: Qt-free and I/O-free, a pure function of
two inputs — ``in_safe_range`` (the radial check shared with the
pre-start gate, fed by the controller's poll) and ``acknowledged`` (the
user clicked Unlock). Hardware reads, the poll, and QML exposure live in
:class:`hydra_bio_cu.stage_scan.controller.StageScanController`.

States
------
``UNKNOWN``
    No reading yet. Fail-closed: slider disabled, but no lock overlay,
    so the overlay doesn't flash before the first (asynchronous) poll.
``SAFE``
    Within the safe range. Slider live; acknowledgement irrelevant.
``BLOCKED``
    Out of range and not acknowledged. Overlay shown, slider disabled.
``UNLOCKED``
    Out of range and acknowledged. Overlay gone, slider live.

Returning to the safe range clears the acknowledgement (RESET_ON_PASS),
so a later excursion prompts afresh; the acknowledgement is scoped to
the out-of-range episode, not the session.
