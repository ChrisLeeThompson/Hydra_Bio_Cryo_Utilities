"""Pre-start check primitives.

A :class:`PreStartCheck` examines a :class:`HardwareSnapshot` and
returns a :class:`PreStartCheckResult` describing one of three
outcomes:

* :data:`PreStartCheckOutcome.PASS` — silent green light.
* :data:`PreStartCheckOutcome.REFUSE` — hard veto with a user-facing
  title and message; the start is refused outright.
* :data:`PreStartCheckOutcome.ASK_CONFIRM` — soft warning; surface
  the title and message to the user and let them decide whether to
  proceed.

Concrete checks live in :mod:`hydra_bio_cu.pre_start_checks.checks`.
Orchestration (running a collection of checks against a snapshot,
deduplicating by type, categorizing results) lives in
:mod:`hydra_bio_cu.pre_start_checks.orchestrator`.

No Qt, no microscope, no I/O — these are pure pieces that consume an
already-gathered snapshot.
