"""Concrete pre-start check implementations.

Each check is a thin :class:`PreStartCheck` subclass — parameterless
from the activity's perspective. Checks are pure functions of a
:class:`HardwareSnapshot`; see
:mod:`hydra_bio_cu.pre_start_checks.snapshot`.

Two checks today:

* :class:`ZLinkedToFreeWorkingDistanceCheck` — hard precondition
  (REFUSE on failure). Required by GIS Deposition.
* :class:`StagePositionWithinSafeRangeCheck` — soft warning
  (ASK_CONFIRM on failure). Required by GIS Deposition, Sputter
  Coat, Home Stage, and the direct Stage Rotation gesture.
