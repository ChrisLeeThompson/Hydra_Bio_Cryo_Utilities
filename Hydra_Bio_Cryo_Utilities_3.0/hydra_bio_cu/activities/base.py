"""Activity base class and shared types.

An :class:`ActivityService` represents one procedure (GIS purge, sputter
coat, etc.) parameterized at construction and executed via :meth:`run`.
Activities are intended to be:

* **Single-use.** Each workflow run constructs fresh activity instances
  from current parameter values. This keeps activities stateless beyond
  their constructor arguments and avoids the need to "reset" them.
* **Synchronous.** :meth:`run` blocks until the activity finishes.
  Threading is the workflow runner's concern, not the activity's.
* **Cooperative on stop.** Activities are passed a :class:`threading.Event`
  and check it at safe interruption points — typically inside any timing
  loop they use, between discrete hardware-setup steps, etc. Operations
  that can't be interrupted mid-call (sputter coater, home stage) simply
  check before invoking and complete fully before the workflow stops.

The threading model is documented in detail in :mod:`workflows.runner`.

    Emits two pieces of state:

    * The traceback to the log via :func:`logger.exception`, tagged
      with ``log_prefix`` and the ``phase`` label
      (e.g. ``"GIS Deposition [abc]: stage move failed"``).
    * A concise status message intended for the activity's status-icon
      tooltip, combining ``status_prefix``, ``phase``, and ``str(exc)``
      with an em-dash separator
      (e.g. ``"GIS deposition: stage move failed — Specified position
      is out of range"``).

    Per the AutoScript SDK, every exception carries a human-readable
    message via ``str(exc)``, so the tooltip surfaces the actual cause
    rather than the bland phase label alone. The exception's type name
    is intentionally not prepended — the message itself is the
    human-readable form. The runner's uncaught-path fallback DOES
    include the type name, because in that case the type is all we
    have for orientation.

        log_prefix: Log-side prefix, typically including ``instance_id``
            (e.g. ``"GIS Deposition [abc]"``). Used only for the log
            line — distinct from ``status_prefix`` so multi-instance
            activities can correlate log entries to specific rows
            without leaking ``instance_id`` into the user-facing
            tooltip.

            ``"opening valve"``). Both the log entry and the status
            read ``"<prefix>: <phase> failed"``.

    # per-instance parameters; none do today.
