"""Gas Injection System hardware ops.

Wraps AutoScript's ``microscope.gas`` with a narrow, intention-revealing
surface. Two implementations live side by side:

* :class:`GISOps` — real, backed by ``SdbMicroscopeClient.gas``.
* :class:`SimulatedGISOps` — in-memory simulation for offline UI development.

Activities take whichever is appropriate via the :data:`GISOpsLike`
type alias and don't care which.

The port pattern mirrors AutoScript's: ``get_port(name)`` returns a
port object with valve and needle control. Activities fetch the port
once at the start of the procedure and hold the reference for the
duration, so cleanup ``close()`` always closes exactly the port that
was opened — even if the configured port name changes mid-run.

Heater control (``turn_heater_on`` / ``turn_heater_off``) exists on
AutoScript's ``GisPort`` but is not currently exposed — Hydra Bio
GIS deposition assumes the heater is already on, managed externally.
