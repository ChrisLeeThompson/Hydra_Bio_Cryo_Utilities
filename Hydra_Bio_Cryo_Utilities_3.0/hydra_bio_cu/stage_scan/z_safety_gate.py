"""Pure state machine for the Z-slider safety gate.

The Z height slider on the Stage / Scan page is gated when the stage is
parked outside the safe range, so the user makes a deliberate choice
before nudging Z from an operationally unusual position. This module is
the decision core of that gate and nothing else: it is Qt-free and
I/O-free, a pure function of two inputs —

    * ``in_safe_range`` — whether the stage is currently within the safe
      range (the radial check shared with the pre-start gate), fed in by
      the controller's poll / activation evaluate.
    * ``acknowledged``  — whether the user has acknowledged the
      out-of-range condition by clicking Unlock.

Keeping it pure mirrors :mod:`hydra_bio_cu.pre_start_checks`: the
hardware reads, the poll timer, and the QML property exposure all live
in :class:`hydra_bio_cu.stage_scan.controller.StageScanController`; this
object only decides the state, so it is testable end-to-end with plain
booleans.

States
------
``UNKNOWN``
    No safe-range reading has arrived yet (gate freshly constructed,
    before the first poll). Fail-closed: the slider is disabled, but the
    lock overlay is *not* shown; the alarm is reserved for a confirmed
    out-of-range reading. This keeps the overlay from flashing on first
    page activation, where the first reading lands asynchronously (one
    worker poll tick) after the page becomes visible.
``SAFE``
    Stage within the safe range. The slider is live; the acknowledgement
    is irrelevant in this state.
``BLOCKED``
    Out of range and not acknowledged. The overlay is shown with the
    Unlock affordance and the slider is disabled.
``UNLOCKED``
    Out of range and acknowledged. The overlay is gone and the slider is
    live for as long as this excursion lasts.

Lifecycle (RESET_ON_PASS)
-------------------------
Returning to the safe range clears the acknowledgement, so a later
excursion out of range prompts afresh rather than staying unlocked. The
acknowledgement is scoped to the out-of-range episode that warranted it,
not to the session.
