"""SessionLog controller — the QML-facing top of the session_log subpackage.

Owns the model, the file path, the in-memory list of Sessions (the
UI's source of truth), and the handlers that turn runner signals
into log entries. Receives workflow lifecycle events via slots that
``AppController._wire_workflow`` connects in step 5; exposes
QML-callable slots for note edits and the Settings-page guarded
clear.

Architecture (one place, said once)
-----------------------------------
* **Source of truth: the in-memory model.** Every event updates
  ``self._sessions`` and the :class:`SessionLogModel` rows
  immediately. The UI reads from there.
* **The file is a best-effort durable mirror.** Writes are tried
  after in-memory updates; failures log and emit
  :attr:`writeFailed`, but never raise upward and never roll back
  the in-memory state. The user keeps seeing what just happened
  even if the disk wrote.
* **Self-heal on vanish.** Tracked via ``_has_been_written``: once
  we know the file should exist, any subsequent append finding the
  file missing triggers an :func:`atomic_rewrite` from the full
  in-memory model plus the new entry. Settings-page ``clearAll``
  resets the flag, so a manual clear is indistinguishable from a
  fresh install on the next write.
* **Running-ness is controller state, not disk state.** The
  ``is_running`` row flag is derived from ``_current_session_id``
  at row-build time via :meth:`_row_for` — the single chokepoint
  every model-row construction routes through. It is never
  persisted and never produced by reconciliation; a crash-orphaned
  session reloads as Interrupted, never Running.
* **Never load-bearing.** Nothing here can abort a workflow. A
  :meth:`parameter_summary` that raised was already absorbed at
  the runner layer; a write that fails here logs and continues; an
  edit on a session that doesn't exist drops with a warning. All
  observational, all best-effort.

Lifetime
--------
``SessionLog`` is constructed eagerly in ``AppController.__init__``
(no microscope dependency, no workflow runners yet). The runner
signals are connected later in
``AppController._create_microscope_dependent_services``, inside the
existing ``_wire_workflow`` helper. Between construction and wiring,
the model is already populated from disk (initial load), so the
page renders correctly even before the microscope client comes up.
