"""Concrete pre-start check implementations.

Each check is a thin :class:`PreStartCheck` subclass — parameterless
from the activity's perspective. Checks are pure functions of a
:class:`HardwareSnapshot`; see
:mod:`hydra_bio_cu.pre_start_checks.snapshot`.

Two checks today:

* :class:`ZLinkedToFreeWorkingDistanceCheck` — hard precondition
  (REFUSE on failure). Required by GIS Deposition.
* :class:`StagePositionWithinSafeRangeCheck` — soft warning
  (ASK_CONFIRM on failure). Required by GIS Deposition, Sputter
  Coat, Home Stage, and the direct Stage Rotation gesture.

    Triggers ASK_CONFIRM (not REFUSE) — the check exists to
    surface possibly-unintended setups, not to block legitimate
    work. The user has final say.

    The threshold is defined in :mod:`hydra_bio_cu.defaults`:

    * The stage's radial distance from chamber center
      (``sqrt(x² + y²)``) must be within
      ``STAGE_SAFE_RADIAL_RANGE_M``.

    The violation message reports the current radial distance
    and the safe range, so the user can decide whether the
    position was deliberate (e.g., a custom liftout geometry)
    or an accident (e.g., still set up from yesterday's
    experiment).

    Tilt is intentionally not part of this check: legitimate
    operating positions (such as the GIS deposition default at
    60°) routinely exceed any conservative tilt threshold, and
    the radial check catches the operationally unusual positions
    where tilt would correlate with concern. If a future need
    for a tilt-aware check appears, ``snapshot.stage_t_rad``
    is still available.

    Boundary semantics
    ------------------
    The comparison is inclusive ``<=`` (see
    :func:`is_within_safe_range`). A position sitting exactly
    at the limit (radial = 5 mm with a 5 mm range) passes — the
    safe range is inclusive of its endpoint. This is consistent
    with how the user reads the threshold in
    :mod:`hydra_bio_cu.defaults` ("5 mm" includes the endpoint)
    and avoids floating-point misery at the boundary.
