"""Cryo Prep workflow runner.

Runs a user-composed list of Cryo activities (Sputter Coat, GIS
Deposition) plus an optional Home Stage at the end. The activity list
and per-activity parameters are owned by :class:`CryoActivitiesController`;
this runner reads them as the workflow runner asks for the next
pending activity.

Iterative-fetch architecture
----------------------------
Activities are fetched one at a time via
:meth:`_next_pending_activity` rather than snapshotted at start. This
lets the user mutate the activity list while a workflow is running:

* **Adding** an activity mid-run (and switching it on) makes it
  pending — the runner picks it up on the next fetch, after the
  current activity finishes.
* **Toggling** a switch off mid-run on a not-yet-started activity
  makes it invisible to the next fetch and so it isn't run. (The QML
  binding locks switches on activities past idle, so toggling never
  affects activities that are already running, complete, or in
  exception.)
* **Deleting** a not-yet-started activity is similarly transparent —
  it's no longer in the model on the next fetch.

Per-activity enabled state
--------------------------
Each cryo activity has an associated UI switch. The switches are
session-only (not persisted) and default to off — the user explicitly
opts in to which activities run on each workflow.

The runner tracks enabled state in two structures:

* ``_enabled_instance_ids: set[str]`` — instance ids of cryo activities
  whose switches are on. QML pushes to this via
  :meth:`set_activity_enabled`.
* ``_home_stage_enabled: bool`` — independent flag for Home Stage.
  QML pushes via :meth:`set_home_stage_enabled`.

The :attr:`canStart` Property derives reactively from these — true
iff at least one cryo activity is enabled OR Home Stage is enabled,
*and* the workflow isn't already running.

Validation
----------
Three passes:

* **Parameter validation at start** — :meth:`_validate_pre_start`
  walks every currently-enabled activity and validates each one.
  On any failure, emits :attr:`validationFailed` for each offending
  activity (collected in one pass so the user sees every problem at
  once) and refuses the start. All-or-nothing so the user can fix
  every problem before retrying.

* **Pre-start check at start** — :meth:`_validate_pre_start` then
  gathers the pre-start checks declared by each enabled activity
  class and runs them through the orchestrator
  (:mod:`hydra_bio_cu.pre_start_checks`). A REFUSE outcome (e.g.
  GIS Deposition enabled but Z not linked) refuses the start with
  the :attr:`preStartCheckRefused` signal; an ASK_CONFIRM outcome
  (e.g. stage in an unusual position) pauses the start pending
  user confirmation via the runner's two-step Start state machine.

* **Mid-run validation** — :meth:`_next_pending_activity` validates
  each activity it's about to return. On a mid-run validation
  failure (e.g. a GIS Deposition added mid-run with no position
  selected), the workflow aborts: emit :attr:`validationFailed` for
  that activity, return ``None`` so the runner ends the loop.
  Aborting rather than skipping reflects the layered-deposition
  physics — successive Sputter Coat / GIS Deposition activities lay
  down dependent material layers, so a missing intermediate layer
  would produce an incomplete sample worse than running fewer
  activities. (A mid-run pre-start check pass is planned alongside
  this — see :attr:`WorkflowRunner._confirmed_check_types` for the
  carry-forward of types the user already confirmed at Start.)

PFIB conditions
---------------
If either :attr:`SettingsController.restoreOriginalPFIBVoltageAndCurrent`
or :attr:`SettingsController.restoreOriginalPFIBIonSpecies` is true,
the runner captures PFIB state once at the start of the workflow and
restores the enabled group(s) once at the end. The two settings map
to the recorder's two restore groups — beam-electrical (high voltage,
beam current, on/off) and ion species (plasma gas) respectively — so
the user can revert one without the other (e.g. restore voltage and
current for imaging while keeping the sputter species). This wraps the
*entire* sequence, including the Home Stage (which doesn't touch PFIB
anyway, but the wrapping placement is consistent and avoids
race-condition ordering questions).

Capture is whole (all four fields); restore is selective per the two
flags. Capture/restore happens via
:class:`PFIBConditionsRecorder` running in the workflow's
:meth:`_before_run` / :meth:`_after_run` hooks (so they execute on
the worker thread, not the GUI thread). The recorder is constructed
in :meth:`_on_commit_to_run` — only when the runner has committed
to actually starting the run (either an outright validation pass or
the user accepting an ASK_CONFIRM dialog) and at least one PFIB-restore
toggle is on. On refused or cancelled starts, no recorder is created
and no PFIB capture happens.

        Three-stage pipeline. Each stage refuses the start outright

        Stage 1 — :attr:`canStart` guard. Defensive: QML should have
        the Start button disabled if no activity is enabled, but if
        :meth:`start` is called anyway, refuse cleanly.

        Stage 2 — parameter validation. Walks every currently-enabled
        cryo activity and validates each one (e.g. GIS Deposition
        references a stale position). On any failure, emits
        :attr:`validationFailed` per offending activity (collected in
        one pass so the user sees every problem at once) and a
        generic StatusBar message; returns ``"refused"``.

        Stage 3 — pre-start checks. Gathers the checks declared by

          :attr:`WorkflowRunner._confirmed_check_types` on accept).
        * PASS → fall through.

        Why all-or-nothing here, vs. abort-on-fetch in
        :meth:`_next_pending_activity`: at start, the user has the
        chance to fix every problem before committing to a run. After
        the run begins, deposition layers are already being laid
        down, and aborting at the first mid-run failure preserves the
        layered-sample integrity (see module docstring).
