# Hydra Bio Cryo Utilities 3

A PySide6/QML desktop utility for the Thermo Scientific Hydra Bio microscope (AutoScript 4.13 or newer).

## Running

Launch the main module from the app folder:

```
python hydra_bio_cryo_utilities.py
```

To open the UI without a microscope connection, pass `--simulation`:

```
python hydra_bio_cryo_utilities.py --simulation
```

In simulation mode the UI is fully navigable but cannot control a microscope.

## Updating

1. Download the latest version from GitHub (Code > Download ZIP, or `git pull`).
2. Copy the new files over your existing app folder, overwriting when prompted. Do not delete the old folder first.
3. Your data is preserved by an update:
   - Saved templates in `templates/` are never overwritten. The shipped default template lives inside the app (`hydra_bio_cu/cryo/factory_templates/`) and is only copied into `templates/` at startup when a file with that name is missing.
   - The session log (`session_logs/session_log.jsonl`) is not part of the download, so it is never touched.
   - Settings, stage positions, and the activity list are stored in the Windows registry, outside the folder entirely.
4. What is replaced: the application code, including the factory templates inside `hydra_bio_cu/`.

## Notes

- If you delete `templates/default.json` it reappears on the next launch (reseeded from the factory copy). To customize the default, edit it and save over it; your version is always kept.
